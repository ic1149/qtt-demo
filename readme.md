# Quick Train Times (QTT) Demo

### Web Demo

[open here](ic1149.github.io/qtt-demo/index.html)

**Please note the web demo DOES NOT function!**

The web demo is simply an illustration of the interface. You can try using the Settings and Config QTT pages. Install the app to actually use it. This is due to limitations of the Fyne toolkit used.
